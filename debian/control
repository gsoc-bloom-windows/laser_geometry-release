Description: This package contains a class for converting from a 2D laser scan as defined by sensor_msgs/LaserScan into a point cloud as defined by sensor_msgs/PointCloud or sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.
 In particular, it contains functionality to account for the skew resulting from moving robots or tilting laser scanners.
